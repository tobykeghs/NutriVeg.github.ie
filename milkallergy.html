                 <p>Milk allergy means an abnormal response by the body's immune system to milk and products containing milk.
                    It's one of the most common food allergies in humans. Cow's milk is the major cause of milk allergy,
                     also milk from sheep, goats, buffalo and other mammals can cause a reaction too.

                    An allergic reaction usually occurs soon after one consumes milk.
                      symptoms of milk allergy range from mild to severe and can include wheezing,
                      vomiting, hives and digestive problems. Milk allergy can also cause anaphylaxis — a severe,
                       life-threatening reaction.
                    
                    Avoiding milk and milk products is the primary solution for milk allergy.
                     Fortunately, some people outgrow milk allergy, but those who don't outgrow it may
                      need to look for other options.</p>

                      <h2>Milk allergy or milk intolerance?</h2>

                      <p>A true milk allergy is different from milk protein intolerance and lactose intolerance. Unlike milk allergy, 
                        intolerance has noting to do with the immune system. Milk intolerance invovles different treatment 
                        from true milk allergy.

                          Common symptoms of milk protein intolerance or lactose
                           intolerance are digestive problems, such as bloating, gas or diarrhea,
                            after consuming milk or products containing milk.</p>

                              <h2>Cause</h2>
                             <p>Though all food allergies are caused by an immune system malfunction. If you develop milk allergies, 
                               your immune system identifies certain milk proteins as harmful, triggering the production of immunoglobulin E (IgE)
                                antibodies to neutralize the protein (allergen). The next time you come in contact with these proteins,
                                 IgE antibodies recognize them and signal your
                                immune system to release histamine and other chemicals, causing a range of allergic signs and symptoms.</p>
                              <h2>Prevention</h2>
                              <p>There are no way to prevent a food allergy, rather than avoiding the food that causes them.
                                 If you know you are is allergic to milk, avoid milk and milk products.

                                  always check food labels carefully. Look for casein, a milk derivative,
                                   which can be found in some unfamiliar places, such as in some canned tuna, sausage 
                                   or nondairy products. Question ingredients before eating in restaurants.</p>
